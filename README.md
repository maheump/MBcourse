This repository gathers together very simple functions for fitting a RL model to behavioral or simulated data from a reversal learning task.
The task used to generate the behavioral data was developed by Hanneke den Ouden and Jill O'Reilly and is freely available (as well as some very similar code of a RL and Bayesian models) at: http://hannekedenouden.ruhosting.nl/RLtutorial/html/TaskDescription.html
